# formExample
It is a form to collect the information of the employees in this I used JSONPowerDB to store the data.
JSONPowerDB is power full database easy to use, easy to learn anyone can learn to use it in no time. I worked with many databases but I enjoyed working with it, I prefer to give it a try, Ibet you wont regret.
It has inbuilt functions that reduces the work can be used by simply callig the API, it also shortens the code and make easy to understand.
JPDB has the help option that describes you use of all the commands and also have example with each command so that anyone can see how to apply command.
